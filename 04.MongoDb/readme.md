### Mongoose
# Car Database Application

This is a Node.js application that uses Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database. The application connects to a local MongoDB server and defines a schema for a collection of cars.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install mongoose
### Explanation [text](db.js)

        -    Ensure MongoDB is running on your local machine before executing the script.
        -    MongoURl: The URL for the MongoDB server.
        -    server: An asynchronous function that connects to the MongoDB server.
        -    Uncomment: the relevant lines in the server function to add data or fetch all documents as needed:
        -    Uncomment: await AddDataMany(); to add multiple documents to the cars collection.
        -    Uncomment: await AddOnedata.save(); to add a single document to the cars collection.
        -    Uncomment: const dataRead = await CarModel.find(); to fetch all documents from the cars collection.
        -    The CarsSchema: defines the structure of the documents in the cars collection.
        -    The CarModel: is the model based on the CarsSchema that we use to interact with the cars collection.
        -    The current setup fetches documents with specific criteria (e.g., age = 1).


### Type Casting
    Mongoose automatically casts data to the specified types in the schema. For example, if you provide a string that can be converted to a number, Mongoose will cast it to a number. If the value cannot be cast to the specified type, Mongoose will throw a validation error. Here's how the types are enforced in the CarsSchema:

    car (String): Mongoose ensures that this field is a string.
    number (String): This field is ensured to be a unique string.
    age (Number): This field is cast to a number.
    city (String): Mongoose ensures that this field is a string.
    isworking (Boolean): This field is cast to a boolean, defaulting to true if not provided.
